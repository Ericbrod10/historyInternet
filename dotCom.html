                <h2>Dot Com Bubble</h2>
                <p>
                    Today when you think of the Internet, the idea of buying things online is one of the most common
                    online activities. Companies like eBay and Amazon are the ones that have taken the first steps in
                    innovating to the internet back in the dot com bubble and you can clearly see how they have
                    benefited their choices from back then. Amazon was founded as an online book company able to offer
                    more books than any one bookshop. eBay was founded in one weekend in 1995 by one man in an attempt
                    to generate an efficient and accessible auction site. </p>
                <p> In the late 1990s to early 2000s, the use of household computers had exponentially accelerated which
                    consisted with Moore’s law where silicon transistors double every 18 months. Amazon and eBay had
                    taken advantage of this explosion of new users in their own ways. Amazon believed in sacrificing
                    profits in the early days to gain users and user growth. The idea behind their actions was to get
                    big fast and then make more profits later down the road. A problem Amazon needed to overcome on
                    their way to success was finding a secure method to transfer information from the buyer to them that
                    did not have the possibility of being seen by a third party intercepting the information. This led
                    to them focusing on public key encryption to safely handle credit card info. eBay on the other hand
                    rebranded as a "collectables" auction website and went public with a two-million-dollar evaluation
                    after day 1. </p>
                <p> The positive analyst reports along with the success of these companies created an overflow of
                    interest in internet tech companies which led to buying frenzies on Wall Street. This would soon
                    lead into the dot com bubble where any company with a dot com attached to its name became a hot
                    commodity and many investors flocked to, rapidly fueling the widest speculative frenzy. Small
                    companies popping up all over the place were coming to light, a good portion of these companies were
                    not profitable but were somehow perceived good by investors. The euphoric movement of investing also
                    led to the beginning of day trading where investors would essentially buy a stock in the morning and
                    sell it sometime the same day. For most of these small companies, venture capitalist Investors
                    assumed the small companies would fail but had the hope some would strike it big as well. </p>
                <p> By 1999, the internet tech market was so highly inflated to a point where even Amazon and eBay,
                    companies that were actually profitable/successful felt their market values were inflated. In 2000,
                    the Fed Chair raised interest rates, popping the bubble leading to what is forever known on Wall
                    Street as "Black Friday". Black Friday was the end of the week in which the NASDAQ had fallen over
                    twenty-five percent, which is the single greatest collapse in the history of the stock market. This
                    was followed by the NASDAQ losing two-thirds of its peak value and plummeting investor confidence to
                    an all time low and most dot com companies that had IPO’d during the bubble were now non-existent.
                    As a result of the huge financial loss, members of Wall Street like analyst Henry Blodgett were
                    blamed as contributors to the bubble. </p>
                <p>Only companies like eBay and Amazon that had strong fundamentals and business models were able to
                    survive the bubble and is a big reason they are still around and thriving today. The one positive
                    note we can see from the stock market is that it contributed to the advancement and growth of the
                    internet infrastructure. This innovation would have eventually happened on its own but the bubble
                    allowed for accelerated progress.
