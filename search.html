                <h2>Internet Search</h2>
                <p>
                    Navigating the internet today is somewhat second nature, if you wanted to find a site that involved
                    “doors” you would go to a search engine and search the word doors and it would give you about one
                    hundred different websites all relating to that search term in a third of a second. Navigating the
                    web so easily was not always the case. Back in the early stages of the world wide web, search
                    engines were not a thing. If you wanted to find some information you would need to search the
                    internet for hours and hope you got lucky with whatever rabbit hole you went into. </p>
                <p> Two individuals, Jerry Yang and David Filo who were graduate students at Stanford University, in an
                    attempt to win a fantasy basketball league started searching the internet for up to date statistics
                    in order to make better informed decisions. They stumbled upon the issue where they had no easy way
                    to navigate or search for the information they needed which greatly lengthened their research
                    process. This is when they developed a guide/directory to help new web users navigate the internet,
                    the original idea was a page that had various topics and web pages sorted into each of them. The new
                    name of this company the two made was Yahoo.</p>
                <p> Excite, another search startup had also begun around the time which had a more technical approach on
                    search than yahoo. Instead of having humans sort pages into various topics, their search would look
                    for relevance within the pages it searched. Yahoo and Excite battled over technical success by being
                    on the forefront of each other's additions, for example releasing emails and having the other
                    incorporate email as well. The search engine companies got caught up in the competition that they
                    lost site of their foundational products which was search. </p>
                <p> While the battle between Excite and Yahoo raged on, a new search company began its inception, the
                    name of this company was Google. Google used a technological approach like Excite however, they also
                    incorporated determining relevance by views. By taking into account relevance, the search engine was
                    able to become more effective than the other search engines. Google pitched their technology to
                    search engine companies all over the valley which none gave them an offer. They had failed to sell
                    their technology and the future looked dim for the small startup, until they met with an investor
                    named Bechtolsheim who invested one hundred thousand dollars in them and this was followed by twelve
                    million from other venture capital investors in the valley. </p>
                <p> Google had essentially solved the single hardest problem on the internet but did not have the
                    ability to make money at the time. They also refused to take money from advertisements like their
                    competitors Yahoo and Excite. Google then learned about Bill Gross’ idea, who saw search engine data
                    collection as the world’s most powerful market research tool. Google had essentially taken Gross’
                    idea which he incorporated into his site overture.com as the solution to their monetary business
                    problem. Bill Gross eventually sued Google for similarities on his idea which they had made a
                    settlement out of court. </p>
                <p> On August, 19th 2004, Google went public and listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange
                    (NYSE). Wall Street had been angered by Google’s IPO process since they decided to carry out their
                    offering in an unconventional way which received much criticism. In the end, the Google IPO was an
                    ultimate success and now we know it as the tech giant it is today.
