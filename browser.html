                <h2>Browser Wars</h2>
                <p>
                    The internet that we know today was nothing like how it was in its early stages. When you think of
                    the internet, the word “browser” along with a few others comes to mind. This is not a coincidence
                    since the creation of the internet browser played a key role in the evolution of the modern-day
                    internet and is regularly used to access it today. The creation of the internet browser was not
                    looked at favorably by all however, Microsoft a large and growing software company saw a
                    browser-based internet as a threat to Windows OS which had been on 90% of the computer in the world
                    at the time. </p>
                <p> Microsoft’s co-founder and CEO, Bill Gates had a different and more monetary inclined vision of the
                    evolution of the internet. His vision thought the information highway that was the internet, should
                    be a toll road where Microsoft controlled the toll booths and the users would have to pay to
                    drive/access information. This would allow Microsoft to have a complete monopoly on information and
                    give them the ability to censor and restrict content that they did not approve of. Gate’s online
                    system was called the Microsoft network (msn) which many assumed would succeed. Microsoft’s
                    motivation for this idea was out of fear that some small software companies could threaten
                    everything Microsoft has achieved like it had done to so many before. </p>
                <p>The first graphical web browser was Mosaic founded by Illinois University students. Jim Clark, the
                    co-founder of Netscape, had recruited the Mosaic engineers. They would go on to create a new browser
                    based on Mosaic and turn the internet into the future for commerce and communication. </p>
                <p>The moment Netscape’s browser “Navigator” was released, it was an instant technological success. The
                    internet age had begun and it did not have anything to do with Microsoft. Microsoft’s fears of the
                    threat had begun to become a reality, Netscape had opened the door to the possibilities where the
                    browser could be a separate alternative to Windows and all computational needs could be handled
                    online rendering Windows OS irreverent. Netscape’s success had become something impossible for
                    Microsoft to overlook anymore and now had to react to this apparent threat and destroy it. </p>
                <p>After meeting with Netscape and being accused of breaching Antitrust Laws, Microsoft had started
                    developing their own browser called Internet Explorer (IE) where they would copy Netscape’s
                    foundational ideas and updates. Their plan was to slowly but surely chip away at Netscape’s browser
                    market share. Microsoft also started approaching customers telling them they’d cancel licenses if
                    Netscape was installed on their hardware which began the events of the breaking antitrust laws. </p>
                <p>In addition to having a monopoly on operating systems and software, Microsoft also had a huge surplus
                    of cash which allowed them to weather any financial storm and give them the ability to release their
                    browser for free while bundled within Windows OS which for Netscape was the beginning of the end. Up
                    until this point Netscape charged money for the use of their software which allowed the company to
                    continue development, but when Microsoft released the free alternative, they had no way to maintain
                    the stream of revenue that they had once sustained. By September 1997, the browser war was over as
                    Internet Explorer made up 80% of all browser users and Netscape had crumbled and was eventually bought
                    out by AOL. </p>
                <p>In 1998, Microsoft was found guilty of breaking antitrust laws and was ordered to break the company
                    up, dropping its stock market value by over 30 billion dollars overnight. Later on, a Fed appeals
                    court had made a decision to rescind the order as there were thoughts it was too harsh.
