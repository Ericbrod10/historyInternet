                <h2>People Power</h2>
                <p>
                    In the early days, media coverage and the spread of information was restricted to media outlooks
                    such as newspapers and new television shows that only broadcasted news that they saw fit. The
                    internet has vastly changed that with the emergence of YouTube which was a monumental shift from
                    traditional media to broadcasting to user-based submissions. This gave the average individual the
                    ability to broadcast their thoughts and opinions to a greater audience without having a big media
                    deem it worthy. </p>
                <p>
                    With the cultural shift to user-based media with YouTube, came a shift in written
                    based media as well with the site digg.com. Digg is a news aggregator with a curated front page,
                    aiming to select stories specifically for the Internet audience. It chooses its stories based on the
                    user's votes and does not rely on an editor or producer to deem a story interesting. </p>
                <p> In addition to personal broadcasting sites came the innovation of MP3 compression sparked
                    computer-based music players. The ability to compress music files to a feasible size was
                    revolutionary for using computers to listen to music. This innovation was highly ignored by the
                    music companies as they did not see it as a threat and decided it would never become a big deal as
                    opposed to traditional means. This left a void on the internet for people who wanted to listen to
                    digital music but had no outlet to obtain it to start file sharing online. </p>
                    <p>A college student named
                    Shawn Fanning saw the need and created Napster which was peer to peer file sharing. Napster did not
                    end intellectual property but it had set music free from the distribution monopoly that the huge
                    record companies had controlled for years. Big names like Dr. Dre and Metallica along with music
                    industry lawyers fought against it. Courts found Napster illegal and made it shutdown. </p>
                <p> Napster may have gained its popularity through illegal copyright means which inevitably caused its
                    downfall, they had inspired the revolution of the creation of copyright protected stores like iTunes
                    which sold individual songs for ninety-nine cents each. As a result, more inspired peer to peer
                    software such as LimeWire and Kazaa were invented to fill the void of Napster. </p>
                <p> With the rise of YouTube and Digg, content created by the crowd had become known as Web 2.0. This
                    ranged from Friendster, to MySpace, Twitter and Facebook which were interactive / social media
                    centric internet sites. The content on these sites were made by the users of the site. The
                    popularity of these sites was enormous and instrumental to Web 2.0. Facebook being at the pinnacle
                    of the success of these social media sites began aggressively expanding like opening up an internal
                    development platform for ads and mini applications. </p>
                <p> Along with the evaluation of Facebook, came the emergence of Craigslist and Wikipedia. Wikipedia was
                    created with hopes of user curated and maintained encyclopedia entries online and Craigslist
                    eliminating need for classified and Peer to peer ads that newspaper outlets had profited on for many
                    years. </p>
                <p> The Dot Com bubble was very monumental for individuals, it not only disrupted almost every industry
                    but it removed some of the power news outlets or music industry companies held securely for years.
                    As a result, the music industry had to change dramatically from their old ways of selling music
                    while the news industry lost revenue and their complete monopoly on the distribution of information.
