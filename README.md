## _The Invention of the Internet_ Notes
* Licklider thought of idea for the internet (ARPANET) at MIT
  *  Dreamed of connecting computers for faster communication

* Kleinrock came up with idea for packet queueing and distributed routing and switching
  * Led to "hot potato" routing, also known as packet switching
  * This is where even if certain links are broken, the message will still get to the endpoint

* Packets are like letters with to and from addresses

* 1969 brought about "time sharing" and the first computer network (Taylor at ARPA)

* ARPANET would use specialized computers to interface and become the "network" called IMPs (interface message processors) 

* Several issues:
  * no common computer or network language
  * how to keep packets from flowing forever
  * how to keep computers from overflowing network
  * computers not meant to run all the time 

* Initially just data files were transferred back and forth. Next big step was email

* Computer networks exploded in popularity after ARPA net demo. 

* LANs and WANs started showing up inside companies and campuses

* Standardization of networks "language" came with TCP IP protocol

* Gateways allowed for different networks to interface with each other

* June 4th 1992 the internet became public instead of government owned

* Bernese Lee created World Wide Web which made it easier for your average person to browse the internet

* In 1992 only 50 pages existed on the internet

* 1993 Netscape was created to make it even easier as the world's breakthrough browser (not the first)
