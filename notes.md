## _The Invention of the Internet_ Notes
	• Licklider thought of idea for the internet (ARPANET) at MIT
		○ Dreamed of connecting computers for faster communication
	• Kleinrock came up with idea for packet queueing and distributed routing and switching
		○ Led to "hot potato" routing, also known as packet switching
		○ This is where even if certain links are broken, the message will still get to the endpoint
	• Packets are like letters with to and from addresses
	• 1969 brought about "time sharing" and the first computer network (Taylor at ARPA)
	• ARPANET would use specialized computers to interface and become the "network" called IMPs (interface message processors)
	• Several issues:
		○ no common computer or network language
		○ how to keep packets from flowing forever
		○ how to keep computers from overflowing network
		○ computers not meant to run all the time
	• Initially just data files were transferred back and forth. Next big step was email
	• Computer networks exploded in popularity after ARPA net demo.
	• LANs and WANs started showing up inside companies and campuses
	• Standardization of networks "language" came with TCP IP protocol
	• Gateways allowed for different networks to interface with each other
	• June 4th 1992 the internet became public instead of government owned
	• Bernese Lee created World Wide Web which made it easier for your average person to browse the internet
	• In 1992 only 50 pages existed on the internet
    • 1993 Netscape was created to make it even easier as the world's breakthrough browser (not the first)

## Browser Wars
	• Mosaic was first web browser? founded by Illinois University students
	• Jim Clark was cofounder of Netscape. recruited Mosaic engineers
	• Microsoft viewed browser based internet as a threat to Windows OS
	• after a meeting between the two, communication broke down
	• Netscape claimed Microsoft was trying to take them out and started to insult them
	• Netscape also hired an antibody trust lawyer to file a suit against Microsoft
	• Netscape started to publicly insult Microsoft
	• Microsoft made it it's mission to destroy Netscape
	• all employees brought in to create and improve internet exploder
	• Microsoft sales teams started to approach customers telling them they'd cancel licenses is Netscape was installed on their hardware
	• by 1997 IE4 was out for free and bundled with OS
	• Netscape crumbled and was eventually bought out by AOL
	• Microsoft was fine guilty of breaking antitrust laws and told to break the company up
    • After an appeals court decision this order was rescinded
    
## Internet Search
	• Yahoo was initially founded to help with gathering data for fantasy sports
	• Yahoo started to take advertising on via banner ads in order to make money
	• Yahoo's first real competition was Excite
	• Excite was the first real search engine and much more powerful than Yahoo
	• They competed to be a one stop shop of the internet with the addition of more and more features
	• Both stopped focusing on search
	• Google comes onto the stage next with a link based algorithm
	• The more links to a page the higher the page ranked in its search
	• Google was initially written off as "just another search engine"
	• Excite was offered the opportunity to buy Google early on when it was only worth about $1 million.
	• Google founders gathered about that much in Venture Capital funding
	• They then got two separate $12 million VCs
	• Google struggled to make money and was bleeding out about $500k a month
	• Google refused to include any flashy or banner ads
	• Bill Gross thought of keyword based data collection for users to create a profile to sell to advertisers
		○ This lead to creation of Overture
		○ Essentially internet based yellow pages
	• Google essentially stole that idea as a way to make money on their site via AdWords
	• Overture and Google settled out of court
	• Google decided to use an auction for their IPO, angering Wall Street
